Have to guess the number that is given:
- The number will be random (19-120)
- need a div/span for it

Need 4 images(Crystals):
- make each image clickable
- each image will have a value (array) (1-12)
- each time player click an image crystal -- the total score will go up in points --  the value that each individual crystal is worth.
- every time it resets it will be a new value 
- game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal



Total score:
- updates when player clicks an image
- the value of the crystal will go there.
- then it will increase by each image  click
- it will add 

Wins:

- when the total score is = guess value then win ++ 1 and the game will reset. 
    - it will display "You Won"

Losses: 

- when the total score is > guess value then lose -- 1 and the game will reset. 
    - it will display "You Lose"

Reset:
 -  when the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. 
 - all the crystals will have four new hidden values. 
- the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
